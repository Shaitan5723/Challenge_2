#Portfolio Page 1.0

This week's goal was to create a portfolio page for myself that could be updated in order to reflect additional projects I complete in the future. Potential employers may use this page to see examples of my work and contact me if they wish to work with me. 

The languages used for this website are HTML and CSS. Future iterations may introduce Javascript as well. 

The webpage is made to be easily navigated, with a navigation bar on top of the page that links to sections further down. The page includes an 'About Me' section, 'My Portfolio' section and a 'Contact Me' section. 

Currently, the portfolio only contains links to two projects (including this one) in the 'My Portfolio' section, but has room for plenty more. There are extra links that redirect to www.google.com until they are replaced with other launched projects. 

The 'Contact Me' section includes links to my email, github, and linkedin.

The page is meant to adapt to the screen size of the viewing device by changing bachground color and collapsing the navigation bar into a vertical elements instead of a horizontal one (should the width decrease). The links to my projects will also wrap around the screen with changes in screen size. 

This is version 1.0 of my Portfolio page. It will be updated in the coming weeks with more information.
